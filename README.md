# Quantum Cryptography (BB84 and B92)
This GitHub repository contains the code and data for the experiments performed
by Felipe Tcach and Charlie Perkins during the Semester 5 Laboratory period
(2023).

## Experimental Aims
The aim of the experiment was to expore the fidelity of information transfer
for the quantum key distrubution (QKD) protocols, BB84 and B92.

## Results and Reasoning
Important results can be found in the root -> results folder of in the repository
root.  Measurements of the ratios of polarised laser light was taken on an
oscilloscope and analysed using Python (see root -> source).  The ratios of
the intensities can be thought of as the approximate single photon probabilities
of detection/resolution.  The values of which can be used to simulate large
scale key distribution many times over - gaining statistical insight into the
QKD protocols.
